# Computation of Collisions using C++

So, I started this project using Python, but Python isn't fast enough any more.

Sooo... ... I'm using C++ from now on.

---

So, the plan is:

1. Running a Python-script (download_data.py) using C++ to fetch the data from the web.

2. Parsing the Data using C++.

3. Calculating the needed values.

4. Blender... .

5. Calculating Collisions.

Compile using:

    $ g++ main.cpp

Run using:

    $ ./a.out
